# Shy - Never Go to an Event Alone Again

## 🎯 What is Shy?

Shy helps socially anxious people attend events by connecting them with someone else who is also going. Instead of walking into a concert, conference, or meetup alone, you find a buddy beforehand—someone to meet up with and make the experience less intimidating.

## 💡 Why It Matters

For many people, the hardest part of attending events is not interest, it is anxiety. The question "Will I have to walk in alone?" often keeps people from going at all. 

Existing solutions fall short:
- **Bumble BFF** is too broad and carries the dating app stigma
- **Meetup** organizes groups, but you still have to arrive solo
- **LinkedIn events** feel professionally pressured

**Shy** solves the specific problem of finding someone for *this* event, *right now*.

## 👥 Who It's For

- Concert-goers, conference attendees, workshop participants
